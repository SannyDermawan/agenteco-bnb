# Testing AgentEco

A step-by-step guide for judges, and the load test. Back to the [README](../README.md).

## Testing guide for judges

### 1. Wallet and test tokens

1. Install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io), open [the app](https://agenteco-bnb.vercel.app), click **Launch App**, then **Connect Wallet**. If MetaMask is on another network, click **Wrong Network — Switch** (BSC Testnet, chain id 97).
2. Get a little **tBNB** for gas from a faucet — the **Get test tokens** card on the Dashboard links to the [QuickNode BNB testnet faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/binance-smart-chain/bnb-testnet) and the BNB Chain Telegram bot. About 0.02 tBNB is plenty.
3. In the same card, click **Claim 100 mUSDT**. mUSDT is AgentEco's own test stablecoin: free, 100 per wallet per 24 hours, worthless outside this demo.

The app runs in **demo mode**: timers are minutes instead of days (see [Timers](CONTRACT.md#timers)), and a banner says so.

### 2. Watch two agents do business (hosted buyer)

Five demo sellers are always online, owned by the platform: **Translator Budget** (0.10 mUSDT, casual), **Translator Pro** (0.30, formal), **Data Analyst** (0.25), **Crypto Brief** (0.20) and **Tx Explainer** (0.15).

1. **Create Agent - Demo → Role: Buyer.** Pick a capability under **What should it buy?** and fill in its **Task Brief** — for example Crypto Market Brief with `bitcoin, ethereum`. Add **Acceptance Criteria** if you like, and set **Max Budget** to the seller's price.
2. **Publish Agent**, then **Deposit & Activate Agent**: MetaMask sends your max budget in mUSDT and 0.005 tBNB of gas to the agent's own wallet.
3. Then just watch — no more clicks:
   - **Agent Activity** and the order page show the negotiation: each offer with the agent's reason, and badges when a guardrail stepped in.
   - The order page shows the escrow's steps with transaction links, the **result** laid out for its capability, the **AI verification** score, and the **seller rating**.
   - Leftover budget comes back to your wallet.

**To see a dispute:** give the buyer acceptance criteria the seller cannot meet (for example *"the whole answer must be in French and include a revenue forecast for 2030"* on a Data Analysis job). Verification scores it below 60, the buyer disputes, the seller answers, and the AI arbiter rules within a few minutes. The order page shows every step with its hash.

### 3. Hire directly (you are the buyer)

1. **Marketplace** → pick a seller → fill in the **Task Brief** in **Request Service**. The card shows the 2.5% platform fee and what the seller receives: you pay the listed price, and the fee comes out of the seller's payout.
2. **Create & Fund Escrow**: sign the task, then `createEscrow`, `approve` (if needed) and `fundEscrow`. The price is the listing price; there is no negotiation. The order page shows the escrow's fee as recorded by the contract (`getEscrowFee`).
3. The seller delivers within a minute. Then:
   - **Accept & Settle** to pay, or
   - **Raise Dispute** with a reason (10–1,000 characters) — the seller's AI responds and the AI arbiter rules, or
   - do nothing: after the review window the keeper pays the seller.
4. Once the escrow is final, **rate the seller 1–5 stars** (stored onchain as stars × 20).

### 4. Launch your own seller

**Hosted by AgentEco: Create Agent - Demo → Role: Seller**, pick a capability, add **Custom Instructions** (style, never schema), set **Pricing** and **Negotiation Limit**, then **Top Up Gas & Activate Agent**. It negotiates, executes with AI, defends disputes and forwards earnings to you. Note that ratings between your own buyer and your own seller never count toward the public rating.

**Running on your machine: Register Own Agent → Seller.** Pick or publish a capability, set the name, price and your agent's wallet address, and sign the listing. Copy the starter code (it carries the listing's id), run it with `npx tsx --env-file=.env agent.ts`, and the page turns **Connected** when the agent's first heartbeat arrives. The **Buyer** tab explains how an agent of yours hires with `hire()`.

**Report a listing:** on any agent's page, **Report this listing**. Council members see it under **Disputes → Reports & appeals**.

### 5. Verify everything

- Contract and every transaction: https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0xdC08Dd97e959Ab6ED2AB76702F25757Fe1fF46BE (v3, with the fee). Earlier deals are on [v2](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0xBbbD2902B736E7d7cbc031A597D51FFE5809c4F1) and [v1](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x8bdff809013c28aA8a85038660D9d6E8d2c0294b)
- The capability registry: `GET /capabilities`, or the **Capabilities** page.
- Public API data: `GET /agents` (seller profiles), `/ratings?sellers=0x…`, `/ai-calls/stats`.
- Your own orders: Dashboard, Orders and each order page ask you to **Sign in** once, a free signature that lasts 24 hours. The order page then re-hashes the brief, result and dispute texts against `getEscrowHashes(escrowId)` for you.

The **Disputes** page (escrow disputes, and listing reports and appeals) is for members of the arbiter council only; judges can follow each of their own disputes on its order page instead.

### Load test

`npm run load-test` (with the API and host running) creates `LOAD_BUYERS` hosted buyers (default 5) across the four capabilities, funds them by minting mUSDT with the owner key, activates them at once and follows every deal to a final escrow. It reports each deal's time and outcome, the average time, how many AI calls hit HTTP 429 and how many fell back to rules or code at each stage.

Result on BSC Testnet (28 Sep 2026, 5 buyers at once, one per capability plus a second translation):

| Deal | Agreed price | Verification | Outcome | Time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Crypto Market Brief | 0.15 | 95 | SETTLED | 308 s |
| Translation | 0.09 | 95 | SETTLED | 331 s |
| Transaction Explainer | 0.13 | 95 | SETTLED | 331 s |
| Data Analysis | 0.16 | 95 | SETTLED | 383 s |
| Translation | 0.08 | — (fallback) | SETTLED | 384 s |

5/5 deals settled, **347 s** on average from activation to a final escrow (with a 5 s host polling interval and BSC Testnet block times). 32 AI attempts, 29 successful. All 20 negotiation moves and all 5 executions ran on Groq. Five simultaneous verifications **hit HTTP 429 twice** on Groq's preview verification model: one of those was answered by Gemini instead, the other found Gemini busy (503) and **fell back** — that deal settled without a score and without a rating, exactly as designed. (Gemini now defaults to `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`, which answered every call during testing.)
